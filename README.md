## About
This app was inspired by my own forgetfulness! When I found something I thought would work as a gift for someone I would save a link as a bookmark or email it to myself. Then eventually, after the occasion the gift was for came and went, I would see the idea again and realize I had forgotten all about it!

This app allows you to create an account in order to save the names of the people in your life you want to save ideas for. Once you create the 'giftee' name there are places for notes about them as well as a place to start saving gift ideas.

The notes area give you places to write about their favorite things, sizes, and general notes.

The Ideas area includes the list of any ideas you've created for them and the form to use to create them. It only requires a title for the idea but gives you space to write:
* Price, e.g. exactly what it was listed for to compre sale prices later, or your budget
* Source, e.g. a direct website link or the name of the store
* Notes, e.g. if they made a comment about wanting something

In the future I plan to come back to the Ideas section and allowing them to be removed.
